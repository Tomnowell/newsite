Well, the last site was pretty but I wanted to move away from jquery and my posts in markdown were being converted to html by 3rd party converter script. While I'm sure it's fine, I wanted to consolidate and improve the underlying structure of my site and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) seemed the best way to do it thanks to it's ability to integrate with Github pages, and it's ease of use and integrated RSS feeds because I am a nostalgic millennial.
