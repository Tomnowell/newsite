![Kirishima shrine in Kagoshima, Japan](/images/kirishima.jpg)

I bought this domain back in 2004 or 2005 when I had aspirations to be a successful musician. MySpace was just hitting its stride. I'd like to say that I foresaw the downfall of that platform and started my website to retain an audience but This site contains some projects I have created and a collection of ramblings and documentation of part of my learning journey. My aim is for it to provide a simple means of contact and a bridge between my neglected social media accounts and my incessant ramblings in an attempt to recall what I was thinking and save my poor wife from listening to me ramble on.
