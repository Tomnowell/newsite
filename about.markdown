# About me!

I'm a Welshman living in Japan. I'm fascinated by cyber security and enjoy software development and making projects in the cloud. I'm into running and am training to complete my first full marathon in March 2024. I play guitar, violin and the piano and sing whenever I get the appropriate opportunity.
